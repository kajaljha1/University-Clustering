# University Clustering

Welcome to the University Clustering project! This repository is dedicated to performing clustering analysis on the "university.csv" dataset. Clustering is a valuable technique for discovering hidden patterns and relationships within data.

## Introduction

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together while keeping dissimilar points separate. In this project, we aim to apply clustering algorithms to the "university.csv" dataset to identify patterns and group universities based on various attributes such as enrollment, tuition, and location.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named "university.csv." It contains information about different universities, including attributes like:

- University Name
- State
- Type (Public or Private)
- Admission Rate
- Tuition (In-state and Out-of-state)
- SAT and ACT Scores
- Enrollment
- Graduation Rate
- and more...

## Clustering Algorithms

We will explore various clustering algorithms, including but not limited to:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Spectral Clustering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice.
- Required libraries and packages (specified in the project's documentation).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kajaljha1/University-Clustering.git

### Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (University_Clustering.ipynb) to access the code and follow the step-by-step instructions for performing clustering on the dataset.
### Results
Document the results of your clustering analysis, including any insights or patterns discovered. Visualizations and summary statistics can be included to facilitate understanding.
